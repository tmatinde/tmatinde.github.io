<h2>Working with the SceneView</h2>

</br>

- Unified 2D and 3D data model (the [`Map`](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/beta/api-reference/esri-Map.html)), [`Layer`](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/beta/api-reference/esri-layers-Layer.html), [`Renderer`](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/beta/api-reference/esri-renderers-Renderer.html) and [`Symbol`](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/beta/api-reference/esri-symbols-Symbol.html)
- Common [`View`](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/beta/api-reference/esri-views-View.html) subclass between 2D and 3D
- Makes it easy (boring!) to transition to 3D
- However, to exploit 3D, you need to learn certain 3D concepts
